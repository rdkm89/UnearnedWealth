O I have .  I have promis'd him my soule .  What interest in this Soule , my selfe coo'd claime  I freely gave him , but his part that made it  I still reserve , not being mine to give .  I hope not so .  Yes Sir I have .  I hope I never bargain'd for that fire ,  Further then penitent teares have power to quench .  You behold them now .  ( If you looke on me with charitable eyes )  Tinctur'd in blood , blood issuing from the heart ,  Sir I am sorry ; when I looke towards Heaven  I beg a gracious Pardon ; when on you  Me thinkes your Native goodnesse should not be  Lesse pittifull than they : 'gainst both I have err'd ,  From both I beg attonement .

Well Cozen this is all you have to do :  Retire the Gallants to some privat roome ,  Where call for wine , and junckets what you please ,  Then thou shalt need to do no other thing  Than what this note directs thee , observe that  An trouble me no farther .  Marry Lasse  To bring a new conceit to passe .  Thy Spirit must borrow more ,  To fill the number three or foure ;  Whom we will use to no great harm ,  Only assist me with thy charme .  This night wee 'l celebrate to sport :  'T is all for mirth , we mean no hurt .  Withdraw then , quicke ,  Now gallants , ther 's for you a trick .  Strike .  Strike .  Strike .  Strike â€”  I' th' Mill there lyes  A Souldier yet with unscratcht eyes ,  Summon the Sister-hood together  For we with all our Spirits will thither ;  And such a Catterwalling keepe ,  That he in vaine shall thinke to sleepe .  Call Meg , and Doll , Tib , Nab , and Iug ,  Let none appeare without her Pug .  We 'l try our utmost Art and skill .  To fright the stout Knave in the Mill .  Is Nab come ?  Where 's Jug ?  But where 's Peg ?  Is he fast ?  Then to work , to work my pretty Laplands  Pinch , here , scratch ,  Doe that within , without we 'l keep the watch .  Good Nephew leave me .  If it be so , excuse my weaknes to him , say I can speake with none .  Yes sir , but now desire no company .  Noyse troubles me , and I would gladly sleepe .  My hand , 't is there .  I pray excuse me .  Alas I have not strength to lift it up .  I am undone .  I will say nothing , but what you know you know ,  And as the law shall finde me let it take me .
