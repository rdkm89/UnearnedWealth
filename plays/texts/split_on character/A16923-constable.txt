 What 's the matter ?  Sir , speake to your companions ,  I have a wife and daughters , and am bound ,  By hourely precepts , to heare women first ,  Be 't truth , or no truth , therefore virgin speake ,  And feare no bug beares , I will doe thee justice .  You are a party , and no witnesse sir ,  Besides y' are two , and one is easier  To be beleev'd : moreover as you have the oddes  In number , what were justice , if it should not support  The weaker side ? Away with them to the Counter .
