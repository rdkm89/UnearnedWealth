 What is his charge ? or whom must he obey ?  Good madam with your wilde authority ;  You are his wife , t is true , and therein may  According to our law , rule , and controwle him .  But you must know withall , I am your servant ,  And bound by the same law to governe you ,  And be a stay to you in declining age ,  To curbe and qualifie your head-strong will ,  Which otherwise would ruine you . Moreover ,  Though y' are his wife , I am a breeding mother ,  Of a deare childe of his ; and therein claime  More honor from him then you ought to challenge .  You have something there to looke to , one would thinke ,  If you had any care . How well you saw  Your father at Schoole to day , and knowing how apt  He is to play the Trewant .  Stand by , and you shall see .  So , so ,  Enough , enough , he will be quiet now .
