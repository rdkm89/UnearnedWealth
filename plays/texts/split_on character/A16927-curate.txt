 See sir , your neighbour Touchwood comes to be reconciled to you .  Let me pray and beseech you to speake more charitably , or else not to offend the dying man with your presence .  Best looke into your selfe Sir : The worlds a stage , on which you both are Actors , and neither to be his owne Judge .  What have you done sir ?  Oh fearefull .  Pray sir depart , you are too uncharitable .  The Virgin sayes  She is depusilated by your sonne .  It is no laughing matter : therefore send  Speedily for your sonne , before the rumour  Make it ridiculous ; as yet none knowes it ,  But we a slender few .  Be perswaded sir .  I have not knowne such want of charity .  What meane you gentlemen ?  For neighbour-hood and Charity speak lower .  Hold mistris Friswood .  Helpe from above , within , or any whence , in the name of sanctity I conjure you . Flectere si nequeo superos , Acheronta movebo .  I feare I have conjur'd up fiends indeed , how infernally they looke ?  They are a paire of the Sedan Mules I take it .  With joy for your recovery , and manners to your privacy , Right Worshipfull I leave you to talke with ' Clowne your Nephew .  Be appeas'd and comforted , good Mr. Britleware , trouble not your head in running after your fate , nor break your weighty braines in seeking wayes after your wives heeles , which are so light by your owne report , they cannot crack an egge .  Besides your wife is your wife where e're she is abroad as we as at home , yea , lost perhaps as well as found : I am now going to yoke a heifer to a husband , that perhaps wil say so shortly : whither away Mr. Trampler ?  Come goe with us and find her .  And Lawyers coÌ„monly are the best upon that sent .  O monstrum horendum ; a man in womens cloathes .  Hinc illae lachrimae , the youth is sure abus'd indeed .  Hem , hem .  Only we kept em back , till our more serious office were ended .
