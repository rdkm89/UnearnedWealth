 And if an husband , why not him she affects ?  Can it befit a Subject to controle  The affection of his Princesse ? Heaven forbid .  Or suppose ,  You might controle it ; whom in your great wisdom  Would you allot the Queen ?  And wish the troublesome spirit were out of you ,  That so distracts your reason .  Silence .  Speak your few words , the Queen can give you hearing .  His lands and goods , Madam , would be thought on .  Your Majesty has perform'd a point of justice  Mingled with clemency beyond all president .  I can but think what old Segebert said  Concerning Laws , Customes and Priveledges .  And how this match will change the Government .  I fear , how e'er the Laws may go , our Customes will  Be lost ; for he me thinks out-flatters us already .  O horrible .  We are dunces to him .  who 'l have an head now for an half penny ?
