 Do you know her Sir ?  What-doe-call her Sir , I pray ?  You are dispos'd I think .  You wont thrust in upon a body whether one will or no .  O me , What do you mean ?  Within . Whether would you go , you wont rob the house will ye ?  He never came so deep himself yet with all that he could do , and I scorne the threatning of a She Marmaset .  Here 's that shall stay your stomack better then the bit you snarle for . Thou greedy Brach thou .  I have as good a spight at as ill a member about thee .  Pray let me go , and let her come .  Let me but try the strength of my teeth upon her .  And must we two fall out for such a slanderous Villain ?  For my part , Sister , sure I was not out with you .  Cuts and slashes too before we part , Sir .  But now we 'll both be revenged upon the flesh of him .  We 'll teach you how to scandalize .  We 'll claw thine eares off rather .  Wheels and whips . I feel what we must go to . Did not I say our stay was dangerous ?
