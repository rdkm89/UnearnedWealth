 Royall pastime , in a great match betweene the Tanners and the Butchers , sixe dogges of a side , to play single at the game Bear , for fifty pound , and a tenne pound supper , for their dogs and themselves . Also you shall see two ten dogge-courses at the Great Beare .  What though  My sight be gone beyond the reach of Spectacles ,  In any print but this , and though I cannot ,  ( No , no , I cannot read your meditations )  strikes downe her book .   Yet I can see the Royall game plaid over and over ,  And tell which dogge does best , without my Spectacles .  And though I could not , yet I love the noyse ;  The noyse revives me , and the Bear-garden scent  Refresheth much my smelling .  Take heed Child what you say , t is the Kings game .  A Beare 's a Princely beast , and one side Venison  ( Writ a good Author once ) you yet want yeares ,  And are with Bawbles pleas'd , I le see the Beares .  Exit .
