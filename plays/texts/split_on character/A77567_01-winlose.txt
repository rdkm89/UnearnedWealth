 It is my part to speak . Mine Host , y'have known me ,  My name is Winloss ; a poor Gentleman ,  Yet richer , by my liberty , then I was  For six years space , till these good Gentlemen  In charity redeem'd me .  It is most true ;  And that from thence these Gentlemen redeem'd me  At their own charge , by paying five hundred pound ,  Which was my Ransom .  Worthy brass tables , and a pen of steel .  T is of my daughter Phillis ! Is she dead ?  But does he keep my daughter to his lust ?  O wretchedness !  O shame unto my blood .  O my child .
