 Which , since I have not yet ; and time must worke it ,  I would make this my suit .  That you would take  With re-acceptance of this thousand pound  Your Daughter and me into your Family .  Dar'st thou yet keep a Groat of thine extorted Wealth ,  And seest what Judgments fall one thee already ?  Can all thy Gold redeem thy good opinion ,  To thine owne Son ? And though thou wouldst no give  ( In case he wanted it ) to save his life ,  A Hangmans Fee , much lesse a Judges thanks ,  Or price of a Lords Letter to reprieve him ;  Yet may this Son survive thee ; and hourely he  Unto thy last houre , thine Affliction be .  Will you be pleasd to see him ?  T is your own money ; sent you by your Son .  Then I shall live , and so may want the money .  Will you forbeare it for a day or two ?  Pray , Sir , take it ;  And give me leave to beg your charitable  Construction of my Father .  Did you but know the care , the cost , and travell  He has been at a thousand waies , to finde  Your injur'd Sister , to make good his fault ,  If possibly he might â€”  No matter . Will you go ?  Will you deny me ?  No matter : Will you on ?
