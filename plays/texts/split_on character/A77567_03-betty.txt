 NAy , you perpetual Pusse , I 'le fetch him out of the very bowels of thee .  Thou hadst been better have bit off the dugs of thy Damme , thou pin-buttock Jade thou , than have snapt a bit of mine from me .  That I could split that divellish tongue of thine !  Let me come but within nailes reach of her .  Did he say so ?  Come Sister we 'll be in for ever now .  But did he say he would kick us ?  Yes , that you shall .  And were we so fond to fight for him ?  Nay , you slave , we 'll mark you for a Sheep-biter .  Have I given you that you cannot claw off , you Mungrel .  Heyday ! his beard comes off .  O me ! the blew Gown Colledge .
