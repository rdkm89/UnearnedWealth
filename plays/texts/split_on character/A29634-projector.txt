 Lay by your Jolity , forbeare your Sport ,  And heare a story shall inforce your pitty .  You had a Master : But to all I speake .  Your practises have sunk him from the Comforts  Of all his hopes in fortune , to the Gulfe  Of deepe despaire ; from whence he rose inflam'd  With wild distraction and phantastick fury .  Mad , and has hang'd himselfe â€”  All over sir , with draughts of Projects , Suits ,  Petitions , Grants , and Pattents , such as were  The Studies and the Labours of his Life ,  And so attir'd he thinks himselfe well arm'd  T' incounter all your scornes .
