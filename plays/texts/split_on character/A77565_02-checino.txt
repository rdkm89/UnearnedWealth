 Forbear such talke ; and think upon the mirth ,  The jest you have in hand against to morrow .  Sir , you mistake , my counsell is to comfort ,  Be not dejected , but seeke speedy way  To circumvent the wit has wrought upon you .  First charge this officer  Here , with this woman ; who by' examination  May make discovery â€”  Into your house sir now , and secure that ;  Come , recollect your selfes , call home the strength  Of your approved judgements , wee 'l assist you .
