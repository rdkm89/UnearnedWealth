 You may now be pleas'd sir to remember that our fathers grew friends at last .  Insooth it is so , we come to negotiate the match for your sonne , and your friendship with old Mr. Striker .  But our fathers lov'd their children .  We are gone sir : onely but wishing you Mr. Touchwood to remember that your sonne 's your sonne .  The touchiest peece of Touchwood that e're I met withall .  All the comfort is , his sonne may yet out-live him .  He cannot be so devillish ; here comes his sonne , a gentleman of so sweet a disposition , and so contrary to his crabbed Sire , that a man who never heard of his mothers vertue might wonder who got him for him .  But he is very seldome and slowly mov'd ; his father often and o' the suddaine .  He is deepe in thought .  Yes , yes ; your father has told us the way .  As much as may restore you to acquaintance  With him againe , can you but make good use on 't .  But thinke withall it is your father , that  Makes this decree ; obey him in the 'execution :  He has a great Estate , you are his onely sonne :  Doe not lose him , your fortune , and your selfe  For a fraile peece of beauty : shake her off ;  And doe some notable thing against her house ,  To please your father   Let me entreate your friendship .
