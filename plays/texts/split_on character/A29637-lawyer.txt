 Why la you now . And am not I a Lawyer ?  That was no fault of mine , nor of my Children .  I 'll think as little of 'em as I can .  Fie ! Canst not yet leave off those Vagancies ?  But I will strive no more to alter Nature .  I will not hinder thee , nor bid thee go .  Come , Friend , I 'll take your Councell .
