 You are well met my Lord .  And you as welcome to the Court my Lord , although a sad one .  Came you now from the King my Lord .  How left you him good my Lord ?  Heaven blesse the King , is he  So dangerously sick ?  Where is Theodrick then , his bosome Friend ,  His special Favourite ? He methinks might gain  The knowledge of his inmost thoughts .  You tell me wonders .  But good my Lord , how takes the King his rest ?  It is most pitiful .  A Pilgrim , why ?  He did indeed my Lord .  My duty binds me to your Highnesse service .  There are wayes  Enough considerable , by which your Highness  May passe , and be receiv'd there undiscovered .  Seeming a private Gentleman , or a Pilgrim ;  But here will rise the difficulty , how  The misse of you at home will be receiv'd  By your Nobility and doubtful People ;  Who cannot long , not knowing where you are ,  But rage in high desire to see your Majesty .  That tryal is soon made ; there 's one already ;  Who 's there ? what 's your businesse ?  My Lord , the King is private , and desires to be so ;  And needs now no attendance but mine own .  Reasonable well .  Your service my Lord , though the King take it not in  At the eye , shall have entrance at the next  Door , the ear ; I 'l make it known to him .  Good night .  Who are you ?  What is 't compos'd of Prayers and meditations ?  Nor your Coat any such practice .  Good Sir , the King 's at rest already .  Fast , fast , and welcome Mr. Doctor .  I 'l wake him with it when he has slept enough .  He had not slept this fortnight else I warrant .  How now ? what sawcie Knave is that ?  Go Fool , follow the Physitian , he can tell you .  And would not you be whipt to come to trouble him then ?  Away you Fool , I 'l set you a going .  This will become a businesse .  Again ?  Your pleasure my Lord Eaufrid .  If you dare take my word , the King commands  The contrary to all men but my self  For this night ; to morrow you may know  His highness further pleasure .  Not if he sleep my Lord .  What shall I say my Lord ?  I say , that you do worse ,  Officiously to interrupt his rest .  How thinks your Majesty of this ? How will  Such as he is be satisfied in your absence ?  Yet more ?  What would you have ?  I may not .  I am amaz'd to see 't ; your own eyes , Sir ,  Cannot in likenesse answer each the other ,  More then this Face doth yours ; his hands , his legs ,  All his dimensions bear the same proportion  To outward seeming as your Royal Person .  Nature herself were she now to behold  Her work on both of you , could scarce distinguish  By an exterior view , a difference .  Where did you find this sleeper ?  I understand your course .  What fury has possess'd 'em ? all our art ,  And the Kings policy will be prevented ,  By the brain-giddiness of these wilful Lords .  And since we can make good our place no longer ,  Post after our King Master , & leave them  With their new King at home here , that 's as mad  As they .  Must ?  Well my Lord , when we see the King in 's wits ,  We 'l tell him of our usage , that he may thank you .  You do consider well , my Lord , and we  Beseech you strive to counter-check these crosses  Still with your Kingly reason .  My Lord , for that before you left the Court  In your suppos'd distraction ; the orebusie Lords  Eaufride and Theodwald , out of strong conceit  The sight of her would cure you , feign'd your letters  Which fetch'd the Queen ; then banish'd us the Court ,  Before we could take notice ; we had been  Strong Traitors else to let that match go forwards .  Nor heard we of it until now the Post  That brings the news o th' Kings and Queens approach  Arriv'd here in the City .  Yes , yes , and though he told us who he was ;  The overwise Lords imputed that to his madnesse .  Where she lik'd him so well  That she now brings him home unto her own .  Still thinking him your person .
