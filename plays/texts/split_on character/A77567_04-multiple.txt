 Your will , Sir .  We thank your Ladiship .  Instantly her eye was fixt ,  And streight ran over my delineaments ,  Which I set to her view ; and took occasion  To ask her how the object pleas'd her .  Good Mrs. Matchil .  You spoke well of him behinde his back : and made me think you lov'd him , and would marry him .
