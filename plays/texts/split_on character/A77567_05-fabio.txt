 'T is she I 'm confident .  No , we ha' found our way , 't is to you we seek : we dare come roundly to you , for all your  Guard , your old Fool , and your young here .  'T is all the Office we are bound to doe you .  Call upon Heaven as you go thitherward :  VVe may not stay long Invocations .  O we are prevented !  For our attempt Sir , we vvill answer it : vve are for the King .  We gave no evidence , nor false nor true .  You dare not do 't : what Law are we condemn'd by ?  The good Eulalia ?  Or may the earth on which we kneel for favour ,  Forc'd by the weight of our detested Sins , open .  All , wee 'l discover all , though justly then we pay our lives to Law .
