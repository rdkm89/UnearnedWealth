 Nay , out King .  Had they taken this way , we had overtaken 'em , or heard of 'em at least .  There was never such an escape else .  The old Justice will run mad upon 't I fear .  You counterfet Villains , hence .  Be gone , I say , you impudent lusty young Rascals .  Come back sirrah . His Patience and Humility has wrought upon me .  There 's a half-penny for you . Let him have no share with you .  Why dost thou follow us ? Is it your office to be privie to our talk ?  This is Courtly !  Some High-way Theef o' my conscience , that forgets he is weaponless .  It had been good to have apprehended the Rakeshame . There is some mysterie in his Rags . But let him go .  We had such another beg'd of us . The Court goes a begging , I think .  T' was to ha' bin yesterday morning ; all things in readiness prepar'd for it . But the Bride , stolne by your Father's Cleark , is slipt away . We were in quest of 'em , and so are twenty more , several waies .  Marry he saies little to the purpose ; but cries outright .  Do your pleasure .  Exit 1.2 .
