 My Lord .  I am not to put on my shape , before  I have spoke the Prologue . And for that my Lord  I yet want something .  I want my Beaver-shooes , and Leather-Cap ,  To speake the Prologue in ; which were appoynted  By your Lordships owne direction .  Certes my Lord , it is a most apt conceit :  The Comedy being the world turn'd upside-downe ,  That the presenter weare the Capitall Beaver  Upon his feet , and on his head shooe-leather .  My Lord we are corrected .  Our farre fetch'd Title over lands and seas ,  Offers unto your view th' Antipodes .  But what Antipodes now shall you see ?  Even those that foot to foot 'gainst London be ,  Because no Traveller that knowes that state ,  Shall say we personate or imitate  Them in our actions : For nothing can  Almost be spoke , but some or other man ,  Takes it unto himselfe ; and sayes the stuffe ,  If it be vicious , or absurd enough .  Was woven upon his backe . Farre , farre be all  That bring such prejudice mixt with their gall .  This play shall no Satyrick Timist be  To taxe or touch at either him or thee ,  That art notorious . T is so farre below  Things in our orbe , that doe among us flow ,  That no degree , from Keyser to the Clowne ,  Shall say this vice or folly was mine owne .  Here my Lord .  T is for my part my Lord ,  Which is not all perform'd .  Then have you lost  Action ( I dare be bold to speake it ) that  Most of my coat could hardly imitate .  Here my Lord .  All my good Lord : and ( in good sooth ) I cannot enough applaude your honours quaint conceit in the designe ; so apt , so regular , so pregnant , so acute , and so ( withall ) poetice legitimate , as I may say justly with Plautus â€”  Nay not so well my exact Lord , but as they may , they shall .  Exit .
