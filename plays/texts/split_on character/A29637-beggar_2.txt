 Sir , he can speak , and could have writ as well . He is a decay'd Poet , newly fallen in among us ; and begs as well as the best of us . He learnt it pretty well in his own profession before ; and can the better practise it in ours now .  What City or Court Poet could say more then our hedge Muse-monger here ?  What say , Sir , to our Poet Scribble here ?  Consort , Sir . We have Musicians too among us : true merry Beggars indeed , that being within the reach of the Lash for singing libellous Songs at London , were fain to flie into our Covie , and here they sing all our Poet 's Ditties . They can sing any thing most tunably , Sir , but Psalms . What they may do hereafter under a triple Tree , is much expected . But they live very civilly and gentily among us .  O Sir , the rarest man of all . He is a Prophet . See how he holds up his prognosticating nose . He is divining now .  Yes Sir , a cunning man and a Fortune-teller : 't is thought he was a great Cleark before his decay , but he is very close , will not tell his beginning , nor the fortune he himself is falne from : But he serves us for a Clergy-man still , and marries us , if need be , after a new way of his own .  What say , Sir , to our Crew ? are we not well congregated ?
