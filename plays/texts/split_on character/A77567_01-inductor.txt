 The Queen of Ethiop dreampt upon a night  Her black womb should bring forth a virgin white .  She told her king ; he told thereof his Peeres .  Till this white dream fil'd their black heads with fears :  Blackheads I sai'd . I le come to you anon   Till this white dream fil'd their blackheads with fear ,  For t is no better then a Prodegy  To have white children in a black countrey .  So 't was decreed that if the child prov'd white ,  It should be made away . O cruel spight !  The Queen cry'd out , and was delivered  Of child black as you see : Yet Wizards sed  That if this damsel liv'd married to be  To a white man , she should be white as he .  The careful Queen , conclusion for to try ,  Sent her to merry England charily  ( The fairest Nation man yet ever saw )  To take a husband ; such as I shall draw ,  Being an Aegyptian Prophet .  Now I come to you , Gentlemen .  You must not have her : For I find by your hand  You have forfeited the mortgage of your land .  Nor you : For here I plainly see  You have sold and spent your lifes Annuity .  Nor you , sir : For  The onely sute you wear smels of the chest  That holds in Limbo Lavender all your rest .  This is the worthy man , whose wealth and wit ,  To make a white one , must the black mark hit .
