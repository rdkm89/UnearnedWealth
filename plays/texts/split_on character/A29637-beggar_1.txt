 Most crowse , most capringly .  Shall we dance , shall we sing , to welcome our King ?  Strike up Piper a merry merry dance  That we on our stampers may foot it and prance ,  To make his heart merry as he has made ours ;  As lustick and frolique as Lords in their Bowers .  'T is well if it like you , Master . But wee have not that rag among us , that we will not daunce off , to do you service ; we being all and onely your servants , most noble Sir .

The Beggar 's ne'r the worse .  For of the general store that Heaven has sent  He values not a penny till 't be spent .  But lately come amongst us , but a very ancient Strowle all the Land over , and has travell'd with Gipsies , and is a Patrico . Shall he read your Fortune Sir ?
