 Yonder 's your Master ,  Goe take him you in hand , while I fetch breath ,  T is well Sir ,  But now ( if thou hast impudence so much ,  As face to face , to speak unto a Lady  That is thy wife , and supreame head ) tell me  At whose sute was it ? or upon what action ?  Debts I presume you have none : For who dares trust  A Ladyes husband , who is but a Squire ,  And under covert barne ? it is some trespasse â€”  Answer me not till I finde out the truth .  Peace ,  How darst thou speake the truth  Before thy wife ? I le finde it out my selfe .  I thinke I ha' found it .  There was a certaine Mercer sent you silkes ,  And cloth of gold to get his wife with child ;  You slighted her , and answered not his hopes ;  And now he layes to arrest you ; is 't not so ?  For shame  Be not ingratefull to that honest man ,  To take his wares , and scorne to lye with his wife .  Do 't I command you ; what did I marry you for ?  The portion that you brought me was not so  Aboundant , though it were five thousand pounds  ( Considering too the Joincture that I made you )  That you should disobey me .  Goe to that woman , if she prove with childe ,  I 'll take it as mine owne .  You know your charge , obey it .  Insooth she speakes but reason .
