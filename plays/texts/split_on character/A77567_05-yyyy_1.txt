 Yes forsooth Mistresse .  We obey the King ,  And 't is his Justice that we cut your throat ,  For doing such outrage in the death of our brave General ,  That had you lives more then false drops of blood ,  They were not all sufficient satisfaction for his losse .  Sav'd him ? how sav'd ?  But does this sound well from a Souldiers mouth ?  He could never come in a better time , to see how bravely we will do justice for him .  We honour both thus low : now gives us leave  To look like men , and give your Highness welcome  To see a General of your Election  Die with a lie in 's mouth : your Souldier here ,  None of the good Queens old ones .
