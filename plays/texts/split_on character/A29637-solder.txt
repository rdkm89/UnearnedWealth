 I 'll be your Souldier . Am not I one ? ha !  Sad for the words of a base Fortune-teller ? Believe him ! Hang him . I 'll trust none of 'em . They have all Whims , and double double meanings In all they say .  Ha' you no Sack i' th House ? am not I here ? And never without a merry old Song ?  Old Sack , and old Songs , and a merry old Crew ,  Will fright away Cares when the ground looks blew .  And can you think on Gipsie Fortune-tellers ?  Will you abroad then ? But here comes your Steward .
