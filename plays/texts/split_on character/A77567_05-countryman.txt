 O neigbours Poggio and Lollio , such a news , such a Discoverie , such a thing is come to pass , such a business is come to light , as your hearts never heard , your Tongues never thought , nor your ears ever utter'd : you cannot hear it , but it will drown you in a Sea of Admiration , never to rise again in your right wits .  It is good or bad I assure you : and therefore you may be gone .  I say it is good and bad : and you may both stay and be gone , hear it or hear it not , an't' please you .  Nay then it is neither good nor bad , but both : the best and the worst that ever you heard in your life , and the worst shall out first : what do you think of the woman that we have got among us ?  Come , shee 's a witch : flatly and plainly said to be a witch .  By two brave men at Arms that came from Court  VVith purpose to have kill'd her for the same .  To be short , They found her out , and naked swords they drew :  But as they thought to have thrust her through and through ,  They both dead Palsie-struck fall to the ground .  And had no strength but of their Tongues to wound  The Fame she had .  VVith that they cryed she was a witch , and swore  She also was that Queen which for a whore  The King had turn'd away .  No , the Queen , if she be the Queen , will not have them hurt more then they be : we wete about to execute 'em : but she would not suffer it .  She would have cur'd 'em presently her self : but could not do 't , because the cruel Caitifs  would not confesse their sins , as she made us , you know , before her gift could cure us : by the same token I suffered an hours torment that I might have scap'd , because I was so loath to bring out that naughtie business betwixt me and the Millers wife .  I , and they will be glad to confess , before they be able to stir hand or foot , I warrant : and so I told 'm when I lodg'd 'em both lovingly together upon straw in my Barn , too good for 'em ; and so I told 'em too , for being Traytors to her Holiness .
