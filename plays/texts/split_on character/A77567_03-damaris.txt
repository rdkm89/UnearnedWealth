 Why should not we in England use that freedome  The famous Curtezans have in Italy :  We have the art , and know the Theory  To allure and catch the wandring eyes of Lovers ;  Yea , and their hearts too : but our stricter Lawes  Forbids the publique practise , our desires  Are high as theirs ; our wills as apt and forward ;  Our wits as ripe , our beauties more attractive ;  Or Travellers are shrewd lyars . Where 's the let ?  Only in bashful coward custome , that  Stoops i' the shoulders , and submits the neck  To bondage of Authority ; to these Lawes ,  That men of feeble age and weaker eye-sight  Have fram'd to bar their sons from youthful pleasures .  Possets and Cawdels on their queasie stomacks ,  Whilst I fly out in brave rebellion ;  And offer , at the least , to break these shackles  That holds our legs together : And begin  A fashion , which pursu'd by Cyprian Dames ,  May perswade Justice to allow our Games .  Who knows ? I 'le try . Francisca bring my Lute .  What 's the matter the Girl cryes out so ?  And what 's your nick-name I pray Sir ?  Then I believe your name is Nicholas .  Nothing not I Sir : sure this is he .  Fie , fie , what talk 's this ? 't is he I am consident .  Good Sir my heart 's too full to utter 't .  Will you be there indeed Sir , I would speak with you seriously .  But do you think hee 'll come as he has promis'd .  I prethee peace , I care not .  I will see no man .  Indeed , I hope you jest .  I 'le flie then out at window . Nay , by this steel 't is true .  I 'll tell thee all anon . Prithie excuse me . I know thy share of his sins bounty would not come to thus much , take it , I give it thee . And prithee let me be honest till I have a mince to be otherwise , and I 'le hinder thee nothing .
