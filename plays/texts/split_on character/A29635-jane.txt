 Yes , and bring himselfe about , J warrant you .  Now hee 's coming :  Beare but with this ; and if he offer not  More then you would request , I le lose your love   Now chop in with him , Mother , you know how apt  Hee is to crosse you in these Moods .  And sayd he would venter 't at the Ordinary .  My Husband , Mother ,  Reports of a rare Creature come to Towne ,  Of a French breed ; a Damoysell , that professeth  The teaching of Court-carriage and behaviour :  The rar'st he saies —  All ages from six yeares to sixty six .  Unlesse they be indocible he saies .  Stift i' the hammes , I think .  Yes , if we give our mindes to 't ; and but steale  Fit times to practise .  The VVorld is turn'd  Quite upside downe : Else I should wonder  How you could make requests , that have got all  You have ( too much ) by Rapine and Oppression .  The Fox here learns to sing .  I heard you , sir , with too much patience ,  Abuse my Husband with your foule Suspition .  Who is as cleer , I know , from wronging you ,  As your own Son .  You are acquainted among the Poets it seems , sir ?  Ha , ha , ha .  You said you would tell us , sir ; What will you tell us ?  What a Dog-trick 's is this ?  Will you not tell us , sir , about your Poet ?  That line is long enough to reach him .  For Courtly carriage and behaviour .  The Damoiselle , I le wait on you . —  Exit .   And young wives ( they say ) wine with their water .  My Father has mist us too , by this time .  I hope she will not . But there 's no crossing her .  What may this mean ?  What did my Husband mean to wish us hither ?  Mother ; what do you mean ?
