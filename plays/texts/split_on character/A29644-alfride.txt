 Sir I am both .  The King shall know your loves , and for your part Master  Speaker .  Then Jeffrey be it , I 'l promise you preferment , if  You will up to Court with me .  My life for thine . And thou shalt not deny me ,  Here 's Gold in earnest , take it . The Kings disease  Is melancholy , and thou mayst do him more good  Then a whole Colledge of Physitians .  Away then as thou art .  Go , carry home your Hawks ; they are as good  As er'e made flight .  I hope my good Lord Ethelswick by this time  Has tane the burden of his discontent  ( The cause of his strong malady ) from his minde .  'T is a strange humour in a King ; and as  Unheard of a disease that works it in him  To hide himself in by-Walks , Caves , and Thickets .  Blesse us ? look here ,  Is not this he ? a witch could not guesse righter  Then thou hast done . Old Ethelswick has lost him ;  And here 's the King asleep .  No , he is warm ; and breathes like health it self .  He has not slept  We know these four nights .  'T is the better for us .  Be it so .  Open the door , and quickly .  Delay not , as you 'l answer 't ;  The King 's here .  We durst have sworn we had had him fast enough here .  Look you my Lord , and judge .  Give us leave to speak .  Let me but speak a word .
