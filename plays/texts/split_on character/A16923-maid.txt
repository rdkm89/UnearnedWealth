Come be not coy , but send away your servant ,  And let me gi' you a pint of wine .  Let me bestow 't  Vpon you at your lodging then ; and there  Be civilly merry .  Gip gaffer Shotten , fagh ,  Take that for your coy Counsell .  Kicks .   That to you sir .  Kicks .   Doe ?  They have done too much already sir : a Virgin  weeps .   Shall not passe shortly for these street-walkers ,  If some judicious order be not taken .  Sir , they assayld me , and with violent hands ,  When words could not prevaile , they would have drawne mee  Aside unto their lust till I cryed murder .  Yes truely .
