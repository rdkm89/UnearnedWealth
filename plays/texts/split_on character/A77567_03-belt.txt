 Her Bellconey ? Where is it ? I can spy from her foot to her face , yet I can see no Bellconey she has .  'T is very good ; I like the jetting out of the forepart very well ; it is a gallant fashion indeed .  I Sir .  Which Bell , Sir ? Adam Bell , with Clim o' th' ' Clough , and William of Cloudesley .  You mean St. George .  Gone in a tempest of high displeasure , sir : And has sent you here all the money he had about him ; and bids you refuse it if you dare , 't is above tvvice the summe he offered you before ; but good sir , do not refuse it . He svvears he vvill try vvhether you or he shall have his vvill . Take heed you crosse him not too much .  I thank you Sir . Consider , he 's your father , sir .  Are you so crafty ?  You never knew an old Serving-man treacherous to his young Master : what ? to the hopes o' th' house ; you will be heire , that 's questionlesse : for to your comfort , your elder brother growes every day more fool then the other . But now the rest of the message is , that you make haste , and come to my Master to the Goat in Covent-Garden , where he dines with his new Landlord to day .  O , a most delicate one , vvith a curious Belconee and all belonging to 't most stately .  Yes sir .  As Lavvyers do their fees . Let me alone sir .  My young Master Mr. Mihil will be here presently , he said he would follow me at heeles , sir .  Thus when any body angers him , I am sure to hear on 't .  That 's his way to his stomach .  Some body has anger'd him , and I must suffer .  I cannot finde 'em sir . They went out of the Tavern together , they say , and I have been at Mr. Mihils chamber , and there they are not . I went to the Tavern again , and there they were not . Then I beat all the rest o' th' bushes , in this fourest of fooles and mad men , and cannot finde em I , where e're they be .  Let me but make one passe at her .  I thank your worship , and truly 't is a goodly sight , me thinks , an 't please your worship .  O sir , O.   O.   I told you then too much . I feel it here .  O good sir .  Sir , there 's hope that he may he fetch 't halfe way back again , by your fatherly advicement , and become a sound man .  But he , sir , will appear a present comfort to you , he is reclaim'd already ; you shall never see such a Reformation in a Gentleman .  He has cast off his long-curl'd haire and all .  Below sir , and a Gentlewoman with him , but very much afraid to appear to you . I never saw a man so timoursome .  I 'le fetch him , here 's a life !
