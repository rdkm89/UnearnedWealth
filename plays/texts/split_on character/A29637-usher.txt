 Do you stand in the Porch , Gentlemen ? the House is open to you . Pray enter the Hall . I am the Usher of it .  And he 's upon coming ; and when he comes he comes apace . He is no Snayle , I assure you .  This Gentleman looks sadly , me thinks .  Pray walk to the Buttry , Gentlemen . My Office leads you thither .  I have been Usher these twenty yeers , Sir . And have got well by my place , for using Strangers respectfully .  Something has come in by the by , besides standing Wages , which is ever duly paid ( thank a good Master , and an honest Steward ) Heaven blesse 'hem . We all thrive under 'em .  Enter Butler with Glasses and a Napkin .  O here comes the Butler .
