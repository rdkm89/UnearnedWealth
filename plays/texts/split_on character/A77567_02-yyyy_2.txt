 By all means have a care that , to any question , we give the King good words to his face ; He is another manner of man here then we took him for at home .  My head itches to be at home again .  Philargus ! O â€”  Philargus , be he living .  What is your grievance , speak ?  'T was more his gentlenes then our deserving ; on .  Now y' are a knave , a villane and a Traytor ,  Lest you no more behind you but a sword ?  I saw a scabberd on your face of late ,  A false one : Seek it out .  No we came in but then . Those are enough  To hang the man , and turn his Lord out of  Our Countrey favour : If we find he has  That plot upon the body of the Princess  Of Rape and Murder . He can be no King  For us : for , sirrah , we have wives and daughters .  Wee 'll keep him tame .  Here 's sweetness upon sweetness .  It sat upon your coat like burs or bryars  Stuck in the hindlocks of our fleecy sheep ;  Who shake their heads ; figgle , and writh their tayls ,  And bleat for woe ; sprinkle the ground behind 'em  Sometimes I wisse : T would make one laugh and pitty 'em  And all at once , but all remediless .  Til we with helping wit and hands release 'em   After our countrey guise .  The why was out , but lome stuck in your teeth .  And there again .
