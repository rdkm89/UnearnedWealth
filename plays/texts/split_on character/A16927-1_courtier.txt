 But Madams will yee dance ?  Musicke , play .  You have done Nobly Ladyes , and much honour'd  This peece of earth here , with your gracefull footing .  May the example of our harmlesse mirth  And Civill recreation purge the place  Of all foule purposes .  We seek not to abridge their priviledge ;  Nor can their ill hurt us ; we are safe .  Agreed .
