 Good Angels , help my thoughts and memory . It is my Kinsman Mihil . What 's the other that hides his face , so ?  It is my Cousin Gabriel , strangely altered .  Sure I will speak to him , he alwayes lov'd me .  Sir .  Pray look upon me , sir .  If you knew who I were , you would not be so strange to me .  Pray sir , but one word .  O Cousins both . As ye are Gentlemen , and of that noble stock , whose meer remembrance , when he was given up , and at the brink of desperate folly , stroke that reverend fear into my soul , that hath preserv'd my honour from further falling . Lend me now your aide , to vindicate that honour by that man , that threw me in the way of losse and ruine .  On my soule I have not .  You were wont still to be my loving'st Cousin .  It is no dream , good Cousin , you are awake ,  And I , that Dorcas , for whom you have wish't  Affinity of blood might be dispens'd with . And you  to be my choice . So well you lov'd me .  How came my Cousin Gabriel thus translated .  Out of gay cloathes long haire , and lofty spirit ,  Stout and brave action , manly carriage ;  Into so strict a Reformation ?  Where is the martial humour he was wont so to affect .  Call not for wine for us , Cousin .  No , nor dreams of me .  No , by no meanes .  You are a noble Spokesman .  Those words are daggers .  Let me entreat you , sir .  O me !  Alas , Cousin , let him drink no more .  O me ! What shall I do ?  But this delays my businesse , Cousin , and will , I fear , frustrate my hopes .  I ask no further satisfaction of you , then to be honested by marriage . I 'le work for a poor living .  My Cousin Mihil said he would bring or send one .
