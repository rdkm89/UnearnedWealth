 Enough of that , I presume Mr. Whetstone , you are not ignorant what belongs to the sport of hunting .  More then any man here I am sure . I should be loath at these yeares to be ignorant of hairing or whoring . I know a hare close hunted , clime a tree .  Nay that 's verie likely , for no man can fish with an angle but his Line must be made of hare .  Enter the Gates with joy ,  And as you enter play the sack of Troy .  It slipt out of my hand , and is falne into crums I think .  Crums ? the divell of crum is here , but bran ; nothing but bran , what prodigie is this ?  How daintily the Brides haire is powder'd with it .  My haire stands an end to see it .  And mine .  I was never so amaz'd !  Pax , I think not on 't , 't is but some of my Father and Mothers roguery , this is a Law-day with 'em , to doe what they list .  I never feare any thing , so long as my Aunt has but bidden me thinke of her , and she 'll warrant me .  Han yeou reeson to complayne or ay trow yeou gaffer Downought ? Wa warth the day that ever I wadded a Downought .  What saies she ?  And so is she bewitcht too into this immodesty .  Some strange fate holds me .
