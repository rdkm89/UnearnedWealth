 My beauteous Doris , first my love presented  Unto your self , my Lord Philargus craves  To know how fares the Princess .  I dare not ( to delay my Lord a minute  Of these glad tidings . ) Stay to prosecute  My love-suit to your self .  Yet my Doris â€”  Be pleas'd to think of me .  Wing'd with that hope , I fly .  Piece up ,  I know your meaning and your jear Varillus ,  In your piece up .  You should not . For  Look back unto the worlds beginning ; there  Youl ' find a Taylor was before a Barber .  Rippe ! there he is again .  As how ?  The scraching of the head .  Lying and stealing went  Of old together : now they are shar'd it seems  Between the Barber and the Taylor .  Your instruments are sharp as mine , Sir Barber ,  And you can pick more out of your Lords ears  Then I take from his Garments with my sheers .  Why him ?  Nay gentle Doris stay . For , t is in vain  To seek our Lords . They are both rod singly forth  To take the Air . Mine an hour since .  As deeply vow'd in friendship as our Lords are .  Suppose so Gentle Doris .  Admired friend , and brother Philocles ,  Your courtesie ore-comes me : I must sue ,  Though my heart akes the while as much for you .  They are gone to take the air already , sir .  That , as the Princesse shall bestow her self  On eithers Lord ; you will embrace his man .  Varillus , come , our Lords may be return'd :  And we be shent for loytering .  O my Lord , fallen dead !  Varillus , I suspect  Doris joyn'd hand with you in my Lords death .  It shall out my Lord ;  The handmaid Doris put him on 't ; I know 't  By what she said to us both we being her lovers .
