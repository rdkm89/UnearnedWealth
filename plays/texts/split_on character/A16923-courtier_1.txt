 This was three shillings yesterday , how now !  All gone but this ? six pence , for leather soles  To my new greene silke stockings , and a groate  My ordinary in Pompions bak'd with Onions .  Three pence I lost at Nyne-pines ; but I got  Six tokens towards that at Pigeon holes —  'S nayles wheres the rest ; is my poake bottome broake ?  What with a vengeance aylst ? dost thinke my breech  Is made of Bell mettall ? take that .  Box o' th eare .   Yes till more comes .  I le teach you to abuse a man behind ,  They buffet .   Was troubled too much afore .  There 's as proud fall , as stand in Court or City .  But I have told you twice and once , Will , jest not  With me behind I never could endure  ( Not of a Boy ) to put up things behinde :  And that my Tutor knew ; I had bin a Schollar else .  Besides you know my sword was nock'd i' th' fashion ,  Just here behinde , for my backe-guard and all ;  And yet you would do 't .  I had a liefe you would take a knife —  O thou art happy that canst reade —  I would buy Ballads too , had I thy learning .
