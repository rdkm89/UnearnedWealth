 These few are thought enough to shew how more  Would appear horrible , the town hath store .  The first 's a Lawyer , who by strife prevail'd  To wed a wife , that was by love intail'd  Unto that Courtier , who had the hap  Soon after to adorn him with that cap .  The next a country cormorant , whose great wealth ,  By a bad fathers will , obtain'd by stealth  That valiant Souldiers Mistress : for which matter  The Enginier his sconse with Rams did batter .  This an old Goatish Usure , that must  Needs buy a wretches daughter to his lust ;  Doated , and married her without a groat ,  That Herald gave this crest unto his coat .  And that 's the Citizen , so broadly pated ,  Which this mad Butcher , cuckold antidated .  Now by this dance let husband that doth wed  Bride from her proper love to loathed bed  Observe his fortune . Musick strike aloud  The cuckolds joy , with merry pipe & crowd .
