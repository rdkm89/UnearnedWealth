 I take my leave Sir , too .  Good Mistris Sneakup .  Pardon me .  You wrong your selfe .  I beseech you forsooth —  BEE comforted Mr. Sneakup ; Remember you are in my Chamber . Beare the heart of a Husband , who scorns to tremble at the face of his Wife ? Do not feare sir .  Boy , sing your song of the Court delights .  Sweet Mrs. Pyannet hold .  Now Beauty blesse me , was not thy mother a notorious Tripe-wife , and thy father a profest Hare-finder ? Gip you Flirt .  Nay , let the Countrey Gentlewoman bee mad and rave on ; she knowes I know my Countrey Gentlewoman had a Bastard before shee was married .  Go to ; you know how in private you commended your Horse-keeper to me .  Out you bawble ; you trifle ; you burden smock'd sweaty sluttery , that couldst love a fellow that wore worsted stockins footed , and fed in Cooks shops .  Alas sweet friend , you and I have been inward a great while , and for us to fall out , and bare one anothers secrets —  Sir , we sent these things to your Wife .
