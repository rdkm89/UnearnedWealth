 Ha , ha , ha .  Ha , ha .  Protest , I cannot abide you .  Sweet Madam , what to do ? ha , ha , I shall be quickly weary with laughing at him . His fooling will soon be stale and tedious ; and then to beat him would be as toilsome to me ; and lastly , to be tied to nothing but to cuckold him , is such a common Town-trick , that I scorne to follow the fashion .  A thousand mile about rather then meet him .  Amard , what 's that ? if you speak French you wrong me .  Speak not you of Mothers , Madam .  Yes , it appears in your good breeding  Your fine qualities expresse her vertues sussiciently .  That 's not every day in a whole week yet .  I could now for him heartily .  Love , as I shall adore thee for a deity .  Rid me of this ridiculous society .  Behinde his back , I may do much to please you . But when I look upon him , he turnes my stomack worse then a fool made of soure milk .  Ha , ha , ha .  Flirt not you at me , Madam , lest I flirt your milk-sop under the snotty nose here .  Ha , ha , ha . â€”  Madam , I hope your Ladiship shall finde me too good for him . If e're he has me .  I 'le wait upon you , though my heart sayes no .  Best tell your mother so ; she may rejoyce at it .  'T is not to finde a fescue , sir , among the Rushes .  To pick out a lesson in your crisse-crosse-row of complement .  Curious acknowledgement ! There was a thrid drawn out .  Fagh , shut that privie-door .  Loves power , I hope , hath wonne on destinie ,  T' appoint this day for my delivery .  Sir , I have put me in your hands you see  So liberally that I may feare to suffer ,  If not a censure , yet a supposition  Of too much easinesse , in being led  So suddenly so farre towards your desire .  But my opinion of your noblenesse  Joyn'd with your Protestation , pleads my pardon  At least it may , the wretchednesse considered ,  To which I was enthrall'd .  Blesse me from being fool-clog'd .  And yet I yield  My self your prisoner .
