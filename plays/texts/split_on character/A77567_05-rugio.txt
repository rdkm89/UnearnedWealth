 But I can tell him comfort .  Yes , and be glad on 't too .  No , but the Queen Alinda has enquired for thee , to entertain thee into her service , whilst we and all the rest of our late Queens servants are turn'd out o' th' Court , and now at this high dinner time too .  Well said Andrea , witty in thy sorrow : I know thou wilt back again for a new Mistresse .  Thou maist not serve her : that will be brought within compass of Relief , and then thou maist be hang'd for her .  Not I Andrea .  There again : now the Queen drinks .  I mean the Queen Alinda .  As here come some to turn us out o' th' Court .  Beseech you , good my Lord : I hope we are true men .
