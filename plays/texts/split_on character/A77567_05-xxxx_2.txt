 Nay then Heaven bless our Sacred Soveraign .  We have no King nor Queen but you .  Heaven bless your Majesty .  VVe dare , and can prove it good and lawful .  This Province is engag'd unto you Madam ,  The King made it your Joynture : and we find  No reason but you instantly possesse it .  You shall obey the King then , and we 'll obey your Majesty .  No whit good Madam . Observe the Dialect of France ,  And you shall find Madam given there in Courtesie ,  To women of low Fortunes , unto whom  'T is held a poore addition , though great Queens  Do grace and make it Royal .  VVhat , shall we hang 'm ? drown 'em ? or burn 'em ?  I , come away with 'em : they shall die fortie times without peradventure ,
