 If I thought so my Lord , we would not doe  Such precious worke for nothing ; we would be  Much better huswifes , and compound for shares  O' th' gardners profit .  Not to improve the garden good my Lord ,  A little for digestion if you please .  By your faire imitation , good my Lords .  T is an honest wish :  But wishes weed no gardens ; hither come  Some wicked ones they say .  But let us walke , the time of day calls hence .
