 Sir excuse me , I have  From time to time supplyed you without hope ,  Or purpose to receive least retribution  From you , no not so much as thankes or bare  Acknowledgement of the free benefits ,  I have confer'd upon you .  Yet doe you now when that my present store  Responds not my occasions , seeke to oppresse me  With vaine petitionary breath , for what I may not  Give without feare of dangerous detriment ?  Pray to what vertuous uses  Would you put money to now , if you had it ?  There 's a crowne .  I have but just a fee left for my Lawyer ;  If he exact not that , I le give it thee .  Sir I am poore , and all I get , is at  The hands of charitable givers ; pray sir .  Then I must follow , and entreate him to it ,  Poore men in law must not disdaine to doe it .  Exit .
