 Yet good unkle .  If not a peece , yet spare me halfe a peece  For goodnesse sake good sir , did you but know  My instant want , and to what vertuous use ,  I would distribute it , I know you would not  Hold backe your charity .  I would bestow a crowne in Ballads ,  Love-pamphlets , and such poeticall Rarities ,  To send downe to my Lady Grandmother .  She 's very old you know , and given much  To contemplation ; I know she 'l send me for 'em ,  In Puddings , Bacon , Sowse and Pot-Butter  Enough to keepe my chamber all this winter .  So shall I save my fathers whole allowance  To lay upon my backe , and not be forc'd  To shift out from my study for my victualls .  I would bestow another crowne in  Hobby-horses , and Rattles for my Grand-father ,  Whose legges and hearing faile him very much ,  Then to preserve his sight a Jack-a-lent ,  In a greene sarsnet suite , he 'l make my father  To send me one of Scarlet , or hee 'l cry  His eyes out for 't .  Doe it then , I le follow you and heare the cause .  Exit .
