 I cannot indure it nor I will not indure it .  One of us two , chuse you which , must leave the house , wee are not to live together I see that , but I will know , if there be Law in Lancashire for 't , which is fit first to depart the house or the World , the mother or the daughter .  Do you say the daughter , for that word I say the mother , unlesse you can prove me the eldest , as my discretion almost warrant it , I say the mother shall out of the house or take such courses in it as shall sort with such a house and such a daughter .  O will yon so , in so doing I may chance to looke upon you . Is this a fit habite for a handsome young Gentlewomans mother , as I hope to be a Lady , you look like one o' the Scottish wayward sisters , O my hart has got the hickup , and all  lookes greene about me , a merry song now mother , and thou shalt be my white girle .  Nay pri'thee sweet Parnell , I was but chiding the old wife for her unhandsomnesse , and would have been at my work presently , she tels me now she will weare fine things , and I shall dresse her head as I list .  And my best art shall trickly trim the Bride .  And I my Mother .  They are all here , and one the merriest Wench ; that makes all the rest so laugh and tickle .  Deare Mother .  O you are a trim mother are you not ?  Long may you live the well-spring of my blisse ,  And may my duty and my fruitfull Prayers ,  Draw a perpetuall streame of blessings from you .
