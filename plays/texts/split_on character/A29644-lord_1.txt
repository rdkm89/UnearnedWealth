 See that through all the Cities , Towns and Villages ,  With solemn Feasts , and publique sign of joy  They celebrate a day for these glad Tydings .  We have provided for your Highnesse journey ,  In such a sort as never King went forth .  Sick ? marry Heaven forbid .  All fools , Sir , shall be whipt .  Yes fool , if they deserve it .  Yes .  And what price or fee will you set upon a fools head  For his admittance ?  The King ( would his infirmity give leave )  Would be delighted in him .  It is most true , in which we may observe  A turn of State . Good Ethelswick was dear ,  Dearly belov'd indeed by our late King ,  And worthily deserv'd his royal Favour .  But with his son , our soveraign Lord that is ,  Youthful Theodrick was prime man in grace ,  And quickly shouldred Ethelswick from Court .  Theodrick's absence now resignes new place  For Ethelswick to reassume the grace .  Thus the Court-wheel goes round like Fortunes ball ,  One Statesman rising on anothers fall .  Let 's wait the coming of the King my Lord .
