 I confesse my stay with thee is sweet to mee , but I must spur Cutt the faster for 't , to be at home in the morning , I have yet to Lancaster to ride to night , and this my bandileer of bottles , to fill to night , and then halfe a score mile to ride by currie-combe time , i' the morning , or the old man chides Mal .  Pray Bacchus I may please him with his wine , which will be the hardest thing to do ; for since hee was last at London and tasted the Divinitie of the Miter , scarce any liquour in Lancashire will go downe with him , sure , sure he will never be a Puritane , he holds so well with the Miter .  Yes Sir . I think I have netled him now , but not as I was netled last night , three hundred Miles a Night upon a Rawbon'd Divell , as in my heart it was a Divell , and then a VVench that shar'd more o' my backe then the sayd Divell did o' my Bum , this is ranke riding my Masters : but why had I such an itch to tell my Master of it , and that he should beleeve it ; I doe now wish that I had not told , and that hee will not beleeve it , for I dare not tell him the meanes : 'Sfoot my Wench and her friends the Fiends , will teare me to pieces if I discover her ; a notable rogue , she 's at the VVedding now , for as good a Mayd as the best o 'em â€” O my Mistresse .  Yes , I have reason to know it after my  hard journey , they say there be light women , but for your owne part , though you be merry . Yet I may be sorry for your heavinesse .  A pox upon your tayle .  A pox take them , must only they feed upon hot meat , and I upon nothing but cold sallads   The brides posset on my life , nay if they come to their spoone meat once , I hope thei l breake up their feast presently .  No doubt Sir .  There Sir .  Yes so I say , either the diuell or she did ; an 't please you walke in and take off her Bridle , and then tell me who hath more right to her , you or I .
