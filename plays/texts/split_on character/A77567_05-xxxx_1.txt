 Heaven bless your Holiness .  We had not liv'd but by your sacred means ;  And will no longer live then be your Subjects .  In honouring our Soveraign ?  He 's dead to you .  And in that , Madam , you are in your content  Above all Title 's proper to great Princes :  But setting this aside , how thrive your Scholars ?  Fough , they stink of Treason damnably   They shall taste fortie deaths , then take their own .  I le make my Barn a spittle for your conspirators till it be top full , and then set fire on 't , and please you .
