 And please you sir —  My Lord an 't please you , if it like your honour .  I aske no satisfaction of the gentleman ,  But to content my wife ; what her demand is ,  T is best knowne to her selfe ; please her , please me ,  An 't please you sir — My Lord an 't like your honour .  But before he has given her satisfaction ,  I may not fall my suit , nor draw my action .  No alacke a day I may not ,  Nor find content , nor peace at home , and 't please you  ( My Lord , an 't like your honour I would say )  An 't please you , what 's a tradesman , that  Has a faire wife , without his wife , an 't please you ?  And she without content is no wife , considering  We trades-men live by gentlemen , an 't please you ,  And our wives drive a halfe trade with us , if the gentlemen  Breake with our wives , our wives are no wives to us ,  And we but broken Trades-men , an 't please you .  And 't like your honour , my good Lord , and 't please you .  Yet gentlemen ,  A lacke a day , and please you , and like your honour ,  Will not consider our necessities ,  And our desire in general through the City ,  To have our sonnes all gentlemen like them .  Right , right , and 't please you :  Your honour my good Lord and 't please you .  Alacke a day .  I , I , alacke a day ,  Nor doe I sue to have him up in prison ,  Alacke a day , what good ( good gentleman )  Can I get by his body ?
