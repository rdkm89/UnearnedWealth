 The King , the King man must be married .  A Wife ? a Queen man , and all the Wives in her Dominion  Must be his Commonwealth , and under us .  And we must son and daughter it upon their Nation .  He 's at hand I warrant you , he went but to Church  E'en now .  No but to help to rear the Tennor , and will come  Presently .  There said you well . The Curate could say almost as much  When 't was . But it makes no matter what he saies , I see  Little amended .  They say 't is waste .  And so we may be sure to make holy day till  We get new ones .  He 's a right Courtier already .  When a mans sword is tane away , it fails him ,  And when he runs away , he gives ground in our  Language .  Alas he was e'en spent before , you saw  The worst of him .  Give us our money Sir , and find 'em you alive , we 'l kill  'Em again for nothing ; and you or any friend of yours into  The bargain if you please .  Is 't come to this ? â€” draw .
