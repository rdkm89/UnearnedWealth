 N' entendes vous , la langue francois Monsieur dittez .  Your faire courtesie  Merits our greatest thanks .  You are before me in the Salutation  Of these faire Ladies , Monsieur Galiard :  I am glad  You like it Lady .  I have before spent many monethes in England :  And my great love unto the Nation ,  Especially to the beauties of your Sexe ,  Retracts me hither , where my friend was never .  Till now that my perswasion wonne his company ;  And happily , I suppose , we are arriv'd :  That , to the sight and knowledge we have had  Of Musick , Daunces , Courtships , and Behaviour .  Through all parts of our Countrey , France , with an  Addition of all Italy affords .  Where ( by all best opinions ) even the choicest  Of such court qualities , and active graces ,  Have had their Spring , we now , as Fame suggests ,  Shall in this faire Society , discerne  More then by all our former observation .  VVhat are your dances chiefly in request .  Agreed , agreed , sir .  VVe are planted to our wish .  'T is then an absolute contract . I am yours .  Fair star of courtship , my unworthy humble self , a Profest servant to the integrity of beauty , makes this  Clear testimony of your merits , that every eye that sees you ,  Owes you his heart for tribute , and that unjustly your beholders live , that live not in your service .  I am forc't to give you over , Madam , you have such a preventing and preoccupying wit in all things .  Sweet Madam , no harm was meant , and nothing said in earnest : 'T was meerly but school practice , but to shew the sweet young Gentleman how he might be subject to the scorne of Court , before he be seen in Complement .  'T was told your Ladiship before , that by reprehension he might finde instruction .
