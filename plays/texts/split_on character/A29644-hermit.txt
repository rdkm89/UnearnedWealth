 Hark , didst thou not hear a cry ?  Peace thou belly-god , 't was there again .  Hast thou not dayly food thou Caterpiller ?  Thou farest as I fare , feedest as ost as I .  Didst thou not hear it now ?  Look up man , canst thou speak ?  Canst thou hold up thy hands , and lift up thine eyes ?  Help up his body , then down into my Cave .  Peace knave , in charity I 'l do my best .  Heaven hitherto my labours well has bless'd .  Didst thou not heat a groan ? a dying groan ?  Hark , look about ; I am sure I heard a groan   And so is pitty amongst men . Ay me ! an old man  Murthered ! A seeming simple innocent old man ,  And yet he holds a sword .  He is yet warm .  Alas , he 's gone indeed ; What ruthless villains  Could have done this on such an aged man ,  In this so harmlesse habit ?  How ill are these white hairs bestain'd with red ?  Methinks I should have known this face . Nothing to wipe  The blood off ? come , help away with him .  Why dost not lift ?  I say I 'l have him down ; perhaps the wounded  Man that 's there may know him .
