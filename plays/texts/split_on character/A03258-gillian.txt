 They 'l search in yonder Meadow ground .  I and my puckling will a brace  Of Greyhounds be , fit for the race ;  And linger where we may be tane  Vp for the course in the by-lane ;  Then will we lead their Dogs a course ,  And every man and every horse ;  Vntill they breake their necks , and say â€”  No succour .
