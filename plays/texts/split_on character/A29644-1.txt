 AND what 's the reason of all this merry glee ?  O but where is Jeffrey , jolly Jeffrey now ? the prick and praise ,  The very prick and praise , and prime Spark of our Parish , to set our Bonefires and our  Mirth a blazing .  So we may make a long holyday indeed .  But Jeffrey , our Masters grudge to give us wood  Enough to make a beaking Bonefire .  But where shall we make this  Houge and monstrous Bonefire ?  And the King to .  It is the Constable .  Nay , we are not such Clowns but we have heard that  Courtiers in favour will know no body .  Now the Dee'l brast crag of him .  You saw the old one dead before your sword  Fail'd you , and you gave ground .  Then we being two against one , we soon dispatched him .  Dead ? sblood , I have told you threescore times  They are both dead ; so is our fellow too , poor Rogue :  He bid us take his share betwixt us , and drink it  To the health of all the Furies in hell , to use  Him the more kindly . Will you discharge us Sir ? we have  Waited for our hire , while we have lost another bargain  Of blood worth two on 't .  What 's the matter ? your conscience sure is crop-sick .  If that be all , the sight of it shall never trouble you-oh . they sink .
