 part of it 's here .  The other we must pull for . But what 's hee ?  Whoope , whurre , here 's a sturre , never a cat , never a curre , but that we must have this demurre .  Pul for the Poultry , Foule , & Fish ,  For emptie shall not be a dish .  Boy , there 's meat for you .  And drinke too .  You our Familiers , come .  In speech let all be dumbe ,  And to close up our Feast ,  To welcome every gest  A merry round let 's daunce .  But stay , where 's the Boy , looke out , if he escape us , we are all betrayed .  Where shall we next met ?
