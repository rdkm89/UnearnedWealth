 I wayt to speake w 'yee sir , but must I stand  Your constring and piercing of your scriblings .  But shall I have the combate ?  Fah on your passages ,  Your windy workings , and your fislings at  The barre . Come me toth ' poynt , is it decreed ,  A combate ?  Now thou hast spoken like a lawyer ,  And heer 's thy fee .  Take it , or I will beat thy carcasse thinner  Then thou hast worne thy gowne here .  Must I then take you in hand ?  Now victory  Affoord me fate , or bravely let me dye .  Exit .
