 Long live our Queen .  Your limited hour draws on apace : Prepare .  He is not now worthy of death , before He be well whipt for lying .  The King , the King , the King !  We dare to kill the Hangman of our General ,  And think it fits our Office best : though you  Have Law enough to wave our care and pain ,  And hang him up your self : for he affirms  That he let Sforza live 'gainst your command ;  And that 's the lie we treat of .
