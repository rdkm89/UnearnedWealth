 My Lord , your judgement is too rash upon them .  Fellows forbear , and forbear you my Lord ,  You shall not so heap blood upon your head ;  I lov'd my Lord your father , and do prize  His blood and memory , as becomes a Servant  Of the best rank : And if at most and worst  My Lord Anthynus here stand guilty of  His fathers death , you must not be his Judge ,  Nor we his Executioners .  No ,  Your Servant Sir , but subject to the Law ;  The Law that must determine this mans cause ,  Not you , nor we , what ever he deserves .  And till he shall be censur'd by that law  We 'l find a Prison for him .  Pray heaven we be , as you may clear your self ;  That 's all the harm we wish you ; this must be  Your course my Lord ; would you heap blood upon you ?  As we go twenty .  But his accuser reads another lesson  Now Madam .  Yes , and speaks hainous things  Against himself , both of my Lords murder ,  And an intended rare against his Sister .  But here comes that  Clears all at once .  Welcome my honour'd Lords .  Hold your peace fool .  Look this way fool ,  This is King Osriick man .  Yes , yes , my Lord , all 's well .
