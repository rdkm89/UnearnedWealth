 Take it quickly , what a Knave art thou to put a letter in my hands , that is directed to my wife . Sbobs I would not ha' open'd it for fourty pound .  Sir , they were call'd in haste to private practice  With some great Ladies in an upper room .  Pardon me , sir .  Our loves were noble , and by due enquirie ,  Fetch 't from each others faithful breast , the knowledge  Of each other .  Sir , I have done . And now that I have said  The worst that might have hapned by his practice ,  To make his shame or his repentance greater ,  VVho only was my aim . VVe are not married ,  None of us all are married one to other .
