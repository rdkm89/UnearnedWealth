 I do not weep ,  Sir , for my self . But ther 's a youth without  ( A handsome youth ) whose sorrow works in me :  He sayes he wants a service , and seeks yours .  No : but I pity him .  T is that Sir , that will grieve you when you hear it .  He is a poor kinsman to the gentlewoman  Lately deceas'd that you so lov'd and mourn for .  Sir , here 's the youth ?  May I crave your name , Sir ?  One she thinks well on Sir ,  No matter for his name , as you said , neither .  Sir , a Gentleman desires to speak with you .  He will not tell it Sir .  I know not , Sir , he vanish'd sodainly .
