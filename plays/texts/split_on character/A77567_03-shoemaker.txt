 I tell you intruth , Sir , 't is as good a boot as ever you pull'd on in your life .  A very neat suite , Sir , and becomes you excellent .  With paying us our money Sit .  Besides , the women begin to grumble against that slippery project shrewdly , and , 't is feard , will mutinie shortly .  As I am a Shoemaker , and that 's a kinde of a Gentleman , you know , I 'll not stirre till I have my money , I am not an Asse Sir .  I have had too many such tricks put upon me i' my dayes .  Well Sir , trick or no trick . I must have my money or my boots , and that 's plain dealing .  No marry will we not .  If you do , Sir , I may hap be even vvith you before the year comes about , and set you in our stocks for 't .  I see your drift , and hope you 'll prove an honest Gentleman .  Alas , Sir , our Masters sit at great rents , and keep great families .  I warrant you , Sir .  The Remitter , you say , is seised i' th' tail .  I pray do Sir .  And you owe us money .  True .  S'ly'd but you shall not , your father shall know all first .  We have all played the Lavvyers to pretty purpose , in pleading all this while for nothing . Well sir , to avoid further trouble , I am content to withdravv my action , that is , pull off your boots again , and be jogging .  'T was for that we did put you to 't Sir .  I thank your vvorship .  He knows both our diets . We 'll make bold to take leave of your worship .
