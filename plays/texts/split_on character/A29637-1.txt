 Neither in Village nor in Town :  But three mile off at Maple-down .  Lead the Horses down the Hill . The heat of  our speed is over , for we have lost our Journey .  But some of our Scouts will light on 'em , the whole Countrey being overspread with 'em .  That a young Gentlewoman of her breeding , and Heire to such an Estate , should flie from so great a Match , and run away with her Uncles Cleark !  Away you idle Vagabond â€”  You would be well whipt and set to work , if you were duly and truly serv'd .  I 'll set you going else .  Switch 'em .   They are of a Fraternity , and will share , I warrant you .  But if Hedges or Hen-roosts could speak , you might be found sharers in Pillage , I believe .  So me thinks . And what o' that ?  Here 's a new way of begging !  With your heels do you ?  Master Oliver , well return'd ; what 's the matter , Sir ?  Dropt through the Clouds , I think ; more Lucifers travailing to Hell , that beg by the way . Met you no news of your Kinswoman , Mistris Amie ?  Your Father is exceedingly troubled at their  escape . I wish that you may qualifie him with your Reasons .  We will accompany you , if you please .
