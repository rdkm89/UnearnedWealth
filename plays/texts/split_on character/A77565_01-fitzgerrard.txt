 I have a private sute to you Madam .  His Lordship Madam shall give mee accompt  To each particular .  And in this respect you shall give me leave  My Lord to call your honour into question .  Where is my Sister Amie ?  Yes , and in honour y' are to answer me ,  It is too evident , your courtship wonne  Her Virgin honour .  The blame of that lay therefore on her selfe ,  That losse I seeke not after : but I aske  Her life and being ( if shee live or be )  Of you my Lord , since it is manifest ,  Shee left her friends , and Country shortly after  Her folly had betrayd her into shame ,  To be at your dispose , as wee presume  She is since in her two yeares absence ; we  Have sought all other wayes in vaine ; you shall  Do therefore well my Lord to render her ,  Or give me leave to urge you t'an accompt  Of what 's become of her .  To hazard of my life I will my Lord .
