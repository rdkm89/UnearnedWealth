 TO me , and to the City , Sir , you are welcome ,  And so are all about you : we have long  Suffer'd in want of such faire Company .  But now that Times calamity has given way  ( Thankes to high Providence ) to your kinder visits ,  We are ( like halfe pin'd wretches , that have lain  Long on the plankes of sorrow , strictly tyed  To a forc'd abstinence , from the sight of friends )  The sweetlier fild with joy .
