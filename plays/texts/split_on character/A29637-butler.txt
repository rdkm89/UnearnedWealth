 You are welcome , Gentlemen . Please yee draw neerer my Office , and take a morning Drink in a Cup of Sack , if it please you .  He 'll come apace when he comes . He 's no Snayle , Sir .  Going .   Or perhaps you had rather drink Whitewine and Sugar . Please your selves , Gentlemen ; here you may taste all Liquors . No Gentlemans House in all this County , or the next , so well stor'd ( — make us thankfull for it . ) And my Master , for his Hospitality to Gentlemen , his Charity to the Poor , and his bounty to his Servants , has not his Peer in the  Kingdom ( — make us thankful for it . ) And 't is as fortunate a House for Servants , as ever was built upon Faery-Ground . I my self , that have serv'd here , Man , and Boy , these four and forty yeers , have gotten together ( besides something , more then I will speak of , distributed among my poor Kinred ) by my Wages , my Vails at Christmas , and otherwise , together with my Rewards of kinde Gentlemen , that have found courteous entertainment here . —  Have , I say , gotten together ( tho' in a dangerous time I speak it ) a brace of hundred pounds — Make me thankfull for it . And for losses , I have had none . I have been Butler these two and thirty yeers , and never lost the value of a Silver Spoon , nor ever broke a Glasse — Make me thankfull for it . White Wine and Sugar , say you Sir ?  This Gentleman speaks not . Or had you rather take a Drink of brown Ale with a Toast , or March Beer with Sugar and Nutmeg ? or had you rather drink without Sugar ?  Here , Gentlemen , is a Cup of my Masters small Beer : But it is good old Canary , I assure you . And here 's to your welcome .  Is our Master come , Sir Domine ?
