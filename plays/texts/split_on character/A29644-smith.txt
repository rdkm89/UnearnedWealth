 Hark , heard ye nothing ? whist .  I pray it prove so .  But we 'l not take away too much at once .  Nay , if we get off clear but with a thousand pound  Amongst us , it will serve for drinking  Money till we come for more .  I fear 't is light gold , methinks he does not weigh  So heavy as he went down . Comrade , what hast thou  Brought ? what ail'st thou ? canst not speak ? I hope thou  Wert not frighted .  Slid , he would cosen us ; how do you look when you lie ?  Oh me !  This is not he ; it is a gastly spirit .  There he is now I am sure .  Until their crusts be done they cannot tell us .  Take up your tools and lead the way .  Come , softly , softly then .  Are not these Sprites ?  They talk methinks ; but I cannot hear what  For shaking .
