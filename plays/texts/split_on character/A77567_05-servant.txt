 The King 's come bravely home ,  And every ear is fill'd with Victory ,  But chiefly with the Fame of Sforza's Valour .  So me thinks too , less 't were to better purpose .  I have told you all the best .  You shall , That you may flie the danger .  Here are Messengers sent from the King to you ; pray Heaven all be well . Ther 's the old tutchie testie Lord , that rails , and never could abide you , since the King look'd from your Honour .  Truely my Lord , I think so :  For if the King had sent to you for good ,  I think he would have sent one lov'd you better .  They come .  You are betray'd :  He 's fled and gone : no such man to be found .
