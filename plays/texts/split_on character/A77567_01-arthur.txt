 This is oppression gentlemen ; an unmanly one .  What fortune 's this ,  I fought 'gainst friends to save mine enemy ,  But I hope neither know me . I desire  To rest hid to my friends for my offence to them ,  And to mine enemy , till I make him dearer .  Suppose your friends should wish you to a match  Prosperous in wealth and honour .  Sir , I ha' done .  Will you have dancing here to night .  Fie upon you .  Yet trust me , sir , there have been large constructions ,  And strong presumptions , that the ill made match  Betwixt her youthful beauty and his covetous age ;  Between her sweetness and his frowardness  Was the unhappy means of her destruction ;  And you that gave strength to that ill tied knot  Do suffer sharply in the worlds opinion ,  While she , sweet virgin , has its general pity .  I nere saw her ,  Nor ever should have sought her , Sir ; For she  Was onely love to my sworne enemy ,  On whom yet ( were she living and in my gift  Rather a thousand times I would bestow her  Then on that man that had , and could not know her .  A goodly creature !  The Rooms illumin'd with her ; yet her look  Sad , and cheek pale , as if a sorrow suck'd it .  Hovv came she in ? What is she ? I am fear-struck .  T is some unresting shaddow . Or , if not ,  What makes a thing so glorious in this house ,  The master being an enemy to beauty ?  She modestly makes to me .  Speaks too .  Speak quickly ; lose no time then : say , what are you ?  You look like one that should not be delai'd .  A blessed tasque ! But when you are freed Lady â€”  Nay , that were cruelty . As you love goodness tell me .  What 's that , if you love ? T is your peace I wait on .  I look upon your service , not mine own .  Were he the mortall'st enemy flesh bred up  To you I must be noble .
