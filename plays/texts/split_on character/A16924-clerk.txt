 Sir , here 's a Delinquent brought before your worship to be examined , a Gentlewoman sir .  Ve‚óèhem the Constable sir .  Sure sir ? The diuell himselfe knowes him not better then I know him from the Diuell . I am sure , hee has beene in see with me these nine yeares : almost euer since hee was Constable ; and has brought more profit to my deske then all the honest Officers in the counties of your Commission sir . Oh hee 's a rare fellow , hee 'll tickle a Whore in Coany .  My Lady Lucklesse man desire to speake with you .  Yes . But good sir stay his comming , I pray you , for his good .  I am glad Fortune has sent one man of Civill government before the Roarers come . Here comes some of 'hem already . I 'le downe and looke to the rest of the house .
