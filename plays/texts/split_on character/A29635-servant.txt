 Sir , the Knight ,  That you expect this day , is come to Towne .  His man has brought 's Portmantue .  Out alas !  I was as ignorant of the deceit ,  As your owne innocent worship ever was  Of cozening any man of Land or Living .  I doubt Sir he was taller .  What else did you intend Sir by the warrant ?  Best lose no time Sir .  No , no , wee 'l go .  No , but a certain Spirit , that my Master  Conjur'd out of his Land .  Mr. Vermine desires to speak with you .  We arrest you , Sir ; Nay , we shall rule you .  VVe do not finde it so ; Or , if it be ,  The place may be as honest as our Office .  VVill you walk , Sir ?  We do not use to wait dry-fisted ; nor dry throated .
