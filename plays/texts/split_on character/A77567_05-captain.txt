 O mighty Sir , Petruccio .  O Petruccio ! I tremble but to speak him .  Dread Sir , vouchsafe attention :  Petruccio is Loyal : 't is his Loyaltie ,  And most sincere obedience to your will ,  That brings him to the ruine of his life ,  Unless your aweful Presence make prevention .  As thus great Sir , in the late Execution  Of Death-doom'd Sforza , which the Souldier  ( Not looking on your Justice , but the Feud  That was betwixt Petruccio and him )  Resents as if it were Petruccio's Act ,  Not yours , that cut him off : and still , as madly  Bewitch'd with Sforza's love , as ignorant  Of the desert of brave Petruccio ,  They all turn head upon him : and as if  'T were in his power to new create him to them ,  They cry to him for Sforza , Sforza ; or if not ,  Petruccio's life must answer Sforza's blood .  He did prevail  With much entreatie , by some private reasons ,  Upon their fury for an hours respite :  In which dear time 't is onely you may save  Guiltless Petruccio from a timeless Grave .  And have commanded in your Highnesse Wars .
