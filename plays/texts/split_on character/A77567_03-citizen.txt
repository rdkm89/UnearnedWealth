 But do ye hear , Gentlemen . I hope you will use me kindlier then so .  Then to win all my money , and leave me at stake for the reckoning . Pray do you pay the Drawer for me , though I pay it you again .  Nay , but Gentlemen .  Well sir , I hope this quarter will not be alwayes lawlesse .  You will not murder me , will you ?  What will you do with me ?  Pray let me speak with you .  — oh — oh — oh .  O , I am very sore .  Alas , my Cloke .  O Sir , in any thing , and thank you too , Sir .  Here they are altogether , sir .  Sir , the parties have given me satisfaction , and I am content they be releas'd .
