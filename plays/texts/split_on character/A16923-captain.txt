 And what 's the issue pray sir ?  Your reason ? I shall then recover nothing .  How have you done sir ?  By this faire hilt , he did sir , and so bruis'd  My armes , so crush'd my ribs , and stich'd my sides ,  That I have had no heart to draw my sword since ;  And shall I put it up , and not his purse  Be made to pay for 't ?  Against all humane reason , for although  I have bought feathers of him these foure yeares ,  And never paid him a penny ; yet he duns me  So desperately to keepe my money still ,  As if I ought him nothing ; he haunts and breaks my sleepes .  I sweare sir , by the motion of this I weare now ,  Shakes it .   I have had twenty better feathers of him , and as ill paid for ,  Yet still he duns me to forbeare my payment ,  And to take longer day .  I ha'not said my prayers in  Mine owne lodging sir this twelvemonths day ,  For sight or thought of him ; and how can you  Compound this action , or the other of  That Russian Coachman that durst lift a hand  'Gainst a Commander .  Pray name no summe in markes , I have had too many  Of 's markes already .  Beate me againe ?  So I le be satisfied , and helpe him to  More customers of my ranke .  Thanke you sir .
