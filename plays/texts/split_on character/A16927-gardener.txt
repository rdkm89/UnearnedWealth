 PRay le ts agree upon 't good wife , you are my wife I take it , and I should have the command , yet I entreate ,  and am content you see .  Let us agree upon 't : and two or three yeares toyle more , while our trade is in request and fashion , will make us purchasers . I had once a hope to have bought this Mannor of Marshland for the resemblance it has to the Low Country soyle you came from , to ha' made you a Banke-side Lady . Wee may in time be somewhat . But what did you take yesterday Mat in all , what had you , ha ?  What did the rich old Merchant spend upon the poore young gentlemans wife in the yellow bed-chamber ?  And what the Knight with the broken Citizens wife ( that goes so Lady like ) in the blew bed-chamber .  That was pretty well for two .  Every thing would live Mat : but here will be great Courtiers and Ladyes to day you say .  T will make them the more eager to come another time then Mat . Ha' they paid their reckoning in the Parlour ?  O here they are going .  I , t is good to misreckon such to be rid of 'hem .  O Sir Arnold Cautious .  No , he comes but to feed his eye , as you say , with leering at good faces , and peeping at pretty insteps .  If you will bestow your selves in the garden , and make choise of your Arbour : you shall have the best cheer the house can afford yee , and you are welcome .
