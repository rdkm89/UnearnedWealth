 My Lord Anthynus .  You are call'd unto your Trial .  Those that are bribe-free I dare warrant 'em .  It may perhaps go somewhat the harder with you ;  For nothing but white innocence can quit you ,  Pray heaven you hav 't about you ; even the King  And Queen , the Queen and King I should have said ,  For she 's our Soveraign , 't is her Law must do it .  King Osriick ; you know nothing .  Take heed Sir what you say .  How ?  Slid , he 's as mad as his brother Offa .  O quite besides himself , and talks the strangliest  Of his fathers murder , your running away  And the desire he has to hang his brother here ;  And then he is haunted with sprites too , they say ;  You will know all anon ; will you go my Lord ?  'T is a kinde part indeed , and may become  A Sister ; like the wife that would not leave  Her husband till she saw him totter .  Set the best foot forward , and the best face  You can , my Lord , upon the businesse .  Exeunt .   Hoboys .  Make way there for the Prisoner .
