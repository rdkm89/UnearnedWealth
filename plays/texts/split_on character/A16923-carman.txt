 I am much oblig'd  Sir , by the plenteous favours your humanity  And noble vertue have conferr'd upon me ,  To answer with my service your deservings .  Still your Courtesies ,  Like waves of a Spring-tide , ore-flow the Bankes  Of your abundant store ; and from your Channell ,  Or streame of faire affections , you cast forth  Those sweet refreshings on me ( that were else  But sterile earth ) which cause a gratitude  To grow upon me , humble , yet ambitious  In my Devoire , to doe you best of service .  Sir , I am no lesse  Ambitious , to be made the happy meanes .  With whip and whistle , to draw up or drive  All your detractors to the Gallowes .  And from  The Court I have the newes at full ,  Of all that was observable this Progresse .  Sir , after you .  Sweet Sir lead on .  Insooth I le follow you .
