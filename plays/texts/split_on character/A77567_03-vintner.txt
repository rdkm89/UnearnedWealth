 You are welcome , Gentlemen . Will . Harry , Zachary .  Where are you ? he ( rings the bell ) shew up into the Phoenix . Is the Checque empty ?  Y'  are welcome , Gentlemen , take up the lillie-pot .  Whose room do they foul Sirrah , Harry , Harry ?  Carry up a Jordan for the Maidenhead , and a quart of white muskadine for the blew Bore .  Harry , Harry .  O tarry , Gentlemen , we are all undone else . If you make not your peace before you stir , both you and I must suffer .  The Magistrates and Officers with their Bill-men have ta'ne us by surprise . They are i' th' house .  There 's no escaping forth . And Gentlemen , It will but breed more scandal on my house , and the whole plantation here , if now you make rebellious uproar . Yield your weapons , and welcome Justice but like subjects new , and peace will follow .
