 Full now my Lord of a new fancy . He  Is now becoming Pilgrim .  I know not why , nor to what shrine , nor do  I hold it fit to ask him ; but to give  Free way unto his fancy yet a while ,  In all to please and play with his infirmity .  'T is our best way to cool Phrenetique humours  Before we kill 'em Sir .  His Pilgrimage shall not be far , though he pretends a long one .  He has on his weeds already .  And who associates him ?  Only my self , and his new fool he saies .  A Physitian and a fool you would say . The Physitian ever  Before the fool , my Lord .  Your Lordships pardon , we must have no Lord  Along with us ; though I was sent to enquire  If you Lord Ethelswick were come to Court ?  Whom the King sent for .  One that must have entrance ; the Physitian ;  One that brings the King a Preparative to sleep .  My books yield no such reading .  I come not to be mock'd , but as you tender  His Highnesse rest , let me approach him presently .  Not asleep ?  My Lord , you 'l let him know my care I hope .  Believe 't my Lord , it was my care that charm'd him .  Pray let him know so much .  Let his passion  A little vent it self , e're you unbind him .  O do not strive my Liege .  He thinks my skull 's made but of urinal mettal .  I , all , all , I know all ; such fancies fall  Naturally into this disease , which now  Is almost a wild Phrensie , that will seldome  Suffer the Patient think himself to be  The person that he is ; nor oftentimes the Creature ,  But some four-footed Beast , or feather'd Fowl :  But could I fasten but a slumber on him ,  Which must be the first entrance to my work .
