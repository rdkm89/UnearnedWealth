 I have not done yet . Now this is to incite you to daunce .  There 's as good Poetry in blank Verse , as Meetre .  Each with a fear the tother will live longest .  So has been many famous men . And if here were no worse , we might have a Masque , or a Comedie presented to night , in honour of the old Couple .  I have already thought upon 't . I want but Actors .  I would present a Common wealth ; Vtopia , With all her Branches and Consistencies .  The Country , the City , the Court , and the Camp . Epitomiz'd and personated by a Gentleman , a Merchant , a Courtier , and a Souldier .  But who the Citizen or Merchant ?  Yet to our Morall I must adde two Persons , Divinity and Law .  But where 's Divinity ?  I would have the Country , the City , and the Court , be at great variance for Superiority . Then would I have Divinity and Law stretch their wide throats to appease and reconcile them : Then would I have the Souldier cudgell them all together , and overtop them all . Stay , yet I want another person .  A Beggar .  He must , at last , overcome the Souldier ; and bring them all to Beggars-Hall . And this , well acted , will be for the honour of our Calling .
