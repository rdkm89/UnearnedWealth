 You must all presentlie to the Paris Tavern .  Mr. Mihil bade me tell you so .  He is , and all his gone and dispersed .  Only there 's one delicate demure Gentleman with Mr. Mihil . travell'd along with him towards Paris . I believe he meanes to make a mouth of him .  They desire to meet you there too , 't is more private .  I am in haste , Sir .  Because he trades in nothing but Turkie commodities ; Egges and Concubines ; 't vvere vvell to geld him , and send him to the Grand Seignior , to vvait in his Seraglio .
