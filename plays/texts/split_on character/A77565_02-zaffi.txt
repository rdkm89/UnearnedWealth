 St. Marke and fortune make it a good prize .  Nor yours I am sure .  Sir you are none o th' Zaffi .  How came you by this habit ?  But who shall know 't for yours sir ?  I cry your worship mercy , and am glad  I was your instrument to preserve this treasure  From this false counterfet .  Mistris come with me .  You shall know that hereafter .
