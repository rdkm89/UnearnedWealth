 Will you honour now ,  Be pleas'd to take into consideration  The poore mens suits for Briefes , to get reliefe  By common charity throughout the Kingdome ,  Towards recovery of their lost estates .  First , here 's a Gamster , that sold house and land ,  To the knowne value of five thousand pounds ,  And by misfortune of the Dice lost all ,  To his extreame undoing ; having neither  A wife or child to succour him .  Yes , my good Lord .  Yes .  Then , here 's a Bawd , of sixty odde yeares standing .  But foure  And twenty , my good Lord . She was both ware  And Merchant ; Flesh and Butcher , ( as they say )  For the first twelve yeares of her house-keeping :  She 's now upon fourescore , and has made markets  Of twice foure thousand choyse virginities ;  And twice their number of indifferent geare .  ( No riffe raffe was she ever knowne to cope for )  Her life is certifi'd here by the Justices ,  Adjacent to her dwelling â€”  Quite trade-fallen , my good Lord , now in her dotage ;  And desperately undone by ryot .  She has consum'd in prodigall feasts and Fidlers ,  And lavish lendings to debauch'd Comrades ,  That suckt her purse , in Jewells , Plate , and money ,  To the full value of sixe thousand pounds .  Then here are divers more ,  Of Pandars , Cheaters , house-and high-way Robbers ,  That have got great estates in youth and strength ,  And wasted all as fast in wine and Harlots .  Till age o'retooke 'hem , and disabled them ,  For getting more   Yet here is one , my Lord , 'bove all the rest ,  Whose services have generally bin knowne ,  Though now he be a spectacle of pitty :  The captaine of the Cut-purses , my Lord ;  That was the best at 's art that ever was ,  Is fallen to great decay , by the dead palsie  In both his hands , and craves a large collection .
