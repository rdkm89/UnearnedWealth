 How know you that , you divell ridden witch you ?  How , quiet ; why quiet ? has not the law past on me ,  Over , and over me , and must I be quiet ?  The lawes the river , i st ? yes t is a river ,  Through which great men , and cunning , wade , or swimme ;  But meane and ignorant must drowne in 't ; no  You hagges and hel-hounds , witches , bitches , all ,  That were the law , the Judge , and Executioners ,  To my vexation , I hope to see  More flames about your eares , then all the water  You cast me in can quench .  Was ever harmelesse creature so abus'd ?  To be drench'd under water , to learne dumbnesse  Amongst the fishes , as I were forbidden  To use the naturall members I was borne with ,  And of them all , the chiefe that man takes pleasure in ;  The tongue ; Oh me accursed wretch .  weepes .
