 Therefore sing Mawd , and call each spright .  Come away , and take thy duggy ,  Now spirits fly about the taske ,  That we projected in our Maske .  Of Seely's family ?  But to be short ,  The wedding must bring on the sport  Betwixt the hare-brayn'd man and mayd ,  Master and dame that over-sway'd .  I that , be now the subject of our chat .  Then we 'll not run  But finde some way how to be gone .  I shal know thee Peg , by thy grissel'd gut ,  And so say I .
