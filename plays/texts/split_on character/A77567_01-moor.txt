 It is to us Sir , We were hir'd to dance and to speak speeches ; and to do the Gentleman true service in his house : And we will not see his house made a baudy house , and make no speech o'th at .  Marry Sir a naughty business . This Gentleman has committed a deed of darkness with your Moor , Sir ; We all saw it .  Darkness or lightness ; call it which you will .  They have lyen together ; made this same a baudy house ;  How will you have it ?
