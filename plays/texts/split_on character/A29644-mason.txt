 Prethee tread softly yet a little further ,  And we are safe .  Hark prethee .  This covetous Lord by this time has laid in  An unknown deal of wealth , I warrant you .  This money will come luckily for a better purpose .  I have three bastards at nurse and a fourth in the Paniers .  The rope stirs ; pull lustily , this pull for a  Thousand pound .  Come , leave your fooling , what money have you ?  What ailest thou ?  Yes , but we have play'd the Divels , till we have  Got a spirit betwixt us .  What art thou that canst look thus Piepeckt , Crowtrod , or Sparrow-blasted ? ha !  What 's the matter Fellow ?  O Cannibal ! wilt thou eat a Carpenter ?  No , we are Divels ; but here 's another crust for thee  What e're thou art ; we have play'd the Thieves to  Very good purpose .  Come , I do suspect the subtilty of this cruel politick  Lord ; would we were well out on 's house . No noise my  Masters , and we 'l bring you to meat enough ; and then  We 'l hear your story , and tell our own ; a word more  Here , may cost all our lives .  Peace , hark .  I 'm glad 't is no worse .
