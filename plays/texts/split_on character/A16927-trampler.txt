 T is as I tell you Mr. Touchwood ; your sonne has lost a faire fortune in the young gentlewoman , and as I conceive by your wilfulnes Sir Arnold Cautions licks his lips at her . I assure you ; and a sweet lick it is , sixe thousand pound in present portion .  He does know all sir .  He knowes moreover , that Mr. Striker , her grandfather has covenanted to give her two thousand pound more at the birth of his first Child , lawfully begotten on her body .  That is not to be thought sir .  And then he had entred into ten thousand pound bond , to leave her his heire if she survive him .  Very lusty , very lively sir .  No sir , I heard himselfe say , that your vexing him has bin his physick , and the best meanes to keep him alive .  I would you could sir , and recover her for your son yet .  Because I love the yong gentleman wel   Though I assure you the writings are all past , sign'd , seal'd , and delivered ; but I have 'hem in my hands yet , and can doe you a pleasure .  And came purposely to advise you , because I loue your son .  Thinke of it sir , and be speedy .  Nay , and you be so hot Mr Touchwood I am gone .  To the wedding house : where I thinke I saw your wife last night Mr. Britleware .  I cannot say directly ; but I think 't was she : does she not call the gentlewoman Aunt that keeps Mr. Strikers house ?  A Surgeon ! I took you for a China shop-keeper Master Britleware ; these by trades are for some by purposes , and I smell knavery .  T is fellony by the Law .  Yes you shall thither .  Come leave your crying : And you beasts up with your luggage , and along with us ; I le fetch such drivers as shall set you on else .  I tell you true , your writings are so past , that if you goe  Not off by composition , you 'll shake your whole estate .  The young Gentleman that sir Hugh had in handling , is in the house , and Master Brittleware with him .
