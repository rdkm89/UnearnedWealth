 A man I hope for my purpose , and save me a going to the Church for one : Will you make an Oath Sir ?  For two shillings ; and it be half a Crowne , my Client shall not stand w' ye ; the Judge is at leisure , and the other of our Bail is there already . Come , go along .  No , nor any man we imploy in these cases .  I cry you mercy : I must up ( I see )  To the old Synagogue , there I shall be fitted â€”  Exit .
