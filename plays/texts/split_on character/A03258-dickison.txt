 Sirah , you have serv'd me well to swindge me thus .  You yong rogue , you have vs'd me like a dog .  Stand up my boie , for thou shalt have no harme ,  Be silent , speake of nothing thou hast seene .  And here 's a shilling for thee .  Nay sirra , though you be yong , and I old , you are not so nimble , nor I so lame , but I can overtake you .  To hugge thee , stroke thee , and embrace thee thus ,  And teach thee twentie thousand prety things .  So thou tell no tales ; and boy this night  Thou must along with me to a brave feast .  Not sirra , then perforce thou shalt along ,  This bridle helps me still at need ,  And shall provide us of a steed .  Now sirra , take your shape and be  Prepar'd to hurrie him and me .  Now looke and tell mee wher 's the lad become .  And that 's the horse we must bestride ,  On which both thou and I must ride ,  Thou boy before and I behinde ,  The earth we tread not , but the winde ,  For we must progresse through the aire ,  And I will bring thee to such fare  As thou ne're saw'st , up and away ,  For now no longer we can stay .
