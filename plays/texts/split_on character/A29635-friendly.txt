 Alas hee 's sore afflicted , and my newes ,  I fear , will strike him dead ; yet I must speak .  Sir , give not misery that advantage on you ,  To make your self the lesse , by shrinking under  The buffetings of fortune .  No , not him .  But I have found what may be comfort to you ,  If you receive it like a man of courage .  Indeed , Sir , hee 's not dead .  Pray , sir , heare me .  Indeed he is not dead ; but lives â€”  Substantially he lives in flesh , as we do .  A Gentleman of the next Chamber told me so .  Onely , sir , this ; if you can brook his absence  Without feare , or mistrust ; then he is well .  He 's gone to travell , sir . Here comes the Gentleman .  I hope  He will accept the Money . Poverty  Was nere so coy else .
