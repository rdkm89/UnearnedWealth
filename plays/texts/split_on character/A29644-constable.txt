 Whither away my friends ?  You must forbear .  You must forbear to make your Bonefire .  I know what I do speak , and what I am .  I know my Office too , by vertue whereof  I charge you in the Kings name , lay by  Your sports and pastimes , I 'l lay you by the heels else .  Will you Sir know a reason ? the King is sick .  He is sick exceedingly .  He 's sick even unto death .  I say no drinking at all , no Bells , nor no Bonefires ,  It is his Majesties command .  Ye will not be all hang'd will ye ? see  Here 's a Gentleman and a Courtier , that so signifies his Majesties pleasure .  You were best look to your fast footing then when  You are high in favour .
