 Meane time entreat my Lord  To put you to some Tellers Clearke to teach you  Ambo-dexterity in telling money .  No my good Lord .  This then : that on the birth of every Girle  The Father pay a groat ; to hearten men  To live soberly and get Souldiers .  The noble Cavalier sir Ferdinando .  They shall not , never feare it .  Among us three . 3.  And we will instantly  Finde his estate . 1.  And lay you down a way  So plaine that you shall say All 's yours ,  Before you stir a foot .  Five you shall my Lord ,  And stand no longer thus in your own light .  T is not the repulse he gave us in the morning shall quit him of us .
