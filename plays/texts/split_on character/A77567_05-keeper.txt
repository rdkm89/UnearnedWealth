 All I can say , 'T is the Kings pleasure , and you must obey .  My Lord , y' are off your Command , and under mine ,  You much mistake your self and me .  Lions may rage in toyles : but whilst they do ,  They more enthral themselves : will you sit down ,  And promise on your Honour not to force  My counsels from me ? I le deal fairly with you ,  ( My meaning is , to give him never a word )  I pitie him : but must not dare to shew it .  It adds to some mens misery , not to know it .  Here my Lord .  Then I doubt not but your Honour has brought VVarrant .  I will not lose the Kings Grace for all the  Honours in the Kingdom .  Yes , I both know and honour you , as far as my own place gives me leave : but in this I must crave pardon ; you may not see him my Lord , by a less VVarrant then the Kings own Signet , and that fetches him out , and it please you .  Not since  These Keys commanded him , I can assure you ,  Not even the Prince himself , who much desir'd it .  I look'd as black on him , as upon you now .  I am no white Prison-Keeper , I , to venture  Mine own Neck for a Prisoner's , at a price ,  And give condemn'd men leave to run away :  No , I am the black Jaylor , I , and 't is thought ,  Lineally descended from Cerberus .  I 'll fetch the Prisoner .  May it please you to come forth , my Lord ?  Here 's the Lord Marshal , and chief General  Of the Kings Forces , come to speak with you .  My Lord .  I shall .
