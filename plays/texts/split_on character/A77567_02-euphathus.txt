 Joy to the king .  Your daughter's safe return'd so is your son , Madam ,  For which you are to thank the Gods : This is  Their true relation .  Caught in the snares of his foul treachery .  And by their hands whose voices he had once  For his election .  They all turn head upon him now .  Fear not my Lord . That doubt  Your Countrey heads will clear . He has lost them  For ever .  My Lord , the King , impatient of your stay ,  Has sent it .  O heavy spectacle !  They are all at hand my liege .  This paper may excuse their stay .
