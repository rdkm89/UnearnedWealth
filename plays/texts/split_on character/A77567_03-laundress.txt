 Not a penny of money , Sir , can I get . But here 's one come to town has brought you enough , and you can have grace to finger it .  Your father , your father Sir . I met his man by great chance , who told me his Master meanes to steal upon you presently , and take you as he findes you .  How ! wo'not away ? And they were well serv'd , they would be thrust out of doors for saucie companions . Your Masters would not put a Gentleman to his trumps thus .  Your fathers talking , as I am a woman , below . â€” As thou art a woman below , well-said . Come on with these Gownes , and le ts see how yow 'll look . If we had time , the Shoomaker should wash his face ; but seeing there is no remedy ; pull the cap in your eyes , and good enongh . Now Laundresse , set us stooles , and leave us .  I hear him coming up .
