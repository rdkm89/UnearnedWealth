 Sir , he has born the name of a Netherland Souldier , till he ran away from his Colours , and was taken lame with lying in the Fields by a Sciatica : I mean , Sir , the strapado . After which , by a second retreat , indeed running away , he scambled into his Country , and so scap'd the Gallows ; and then snap'd up his living in the City by his wit in cheating , pimping , and such like Arts , till the Cart and the Pillory shewed him too publiquely to the world . And so , begging being the last refuge , he enter'd into our society . And now lives honestly , I must needs say , as the best of us .
