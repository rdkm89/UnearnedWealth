 I have not in all Spaine ( where Majesty  Enthroned sits upon the brow of beauty ,  And crowne the Ladies with prerogative  'Bove all the women of the Earth ) incountred  With such a scorne , as here . Discourteous woman ,  Worthlesse and ignorant of the weighty trust  Was tenderd to thee in my blood and honour .  I will not change a word more with a mouth  So full of rudenes , and mechanick basenesse .  It must be great and sodaine if it move me .  Why seeke you not to expiate your trespasse  By tender of your selfe to my embraces ?  I 'le no more delay ,  I see t is only force must conquer you .  Villaine , I 'le have thee whipp'd for this affront ,  Thy fault is punishable by the Law .  Villaine die .  Borne down by Bravoes ! let the place protect ye ,  By my few minutes patience . My revenge  Shall shortly speake in thunder .  Well sir I am silent .  Abus'd and Jeer'd !  Take from my hand a peece of foure Gazetts .  Sir by good appointment  To bring Bride-laces , Gloves , and curious Dressings  To deck your Daughter on her Brideale-day ,  To morrow as I weene , holds it I pray ?  If you could put it off sir one day longer  I could so fit her with new fashiond tires  That shee should thanke me .  I can discover nothing but my ware sir ,  Nor part with that for lesse then ready money .  VVhither ? for what ?  VVhat can I discover ?  VVhat can I discover ?  And this is the Gentlewoman .  This is the stranger , that affronted me ;  'Gainst whom I crave your Justice .  Nor I , I will be sworne .  It was my duty sir for the reward ,  VVee all would live you know .  I hope I am discharg'd : for looke you sir ,  I brought you where you finde your Daughter safe .  No whit the worse for wearing , as they say .  At my owne liberty I hope .  May you see your Childrens , Childrens , Childrens , Children .  Right , worthy Signior , that 's the man I Challenge .  That is the man I challenge .
