 'T is not amisse to help for expedition .  Oh , oh , some help , oh .  Both dead and buried ;  The Mould is not more dead from which  The gold was tane , which we attend for ,  Then are their corps .  O help ! where am I ? drawn from one hell into another ? ha !  Had I the price of Kingdoms I 'd give all  But for one bit of meat ; but I have none .  What ? are you men ?  If you be men , help me to food , a little food .  O , I am pin'd with hunger .  S'death , it is he .
