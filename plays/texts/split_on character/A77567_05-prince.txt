 Pray Mother hear the dangers too ; the worst  Will make the best the sweeter : I could hear  Of dangers yet to come ; and Women may  Discourse of Perils past each Holy-day .  How this old fellow talkes ! you said , my Lord ,  You would discourse the Battail .  Good mother .  I do not hope t' outlive you Sir , but if I must ,  I sure shall hope to keep your name and right  Alive whilst I live , though I cannot hope  To have so good a Souldier at my Standard  As Warlike Sforza .
