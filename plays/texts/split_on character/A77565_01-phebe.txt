 Your Masters gone forth it seemes .  Shuns he the sight of me ? I 'le overtake him .  For let me tell thee Mistris Phebe bright Hee 's reconciled to his Unkle Knight .  Away Pimpe , Flamsted , I came to be serious with him , to let him know the miseries I suffer , by the wrongs hee has done mee , and that I can nor will no longer beare 'em .  No nor him neither , you pandarly Parasite , till he make his vowes good , and me an honest Woman .  Sirra , I will claw your ugly Face till thou undertak'st it with him , to make it easie .  O will you so ?  You know I have a wealthy Kinsman in the City .  Pimpe impudent , shall I claw your Face into blushes at my injuryes , to be mockt out of my Maydenhead , when I was upon a good Match in the Countrey ; Then with a promise of Marriage , to be intic'd from my friends into fooles Paradice ( that was a new title for the City ) and here to be used , and abused from Lodging to Lodging , by him that now flies me , for the decayes hee hath brought mee to ? But my Kinsman has money though I have none , and for money there is Law to be found , and in a just cause he will not let me sink , he sayes : for I have told him all .  Sirrah , I shall shew you and your Master too a way to more civility , since I am thus abused , and slighted .  Away you Creature .  Away you Creature .  You are no saucy Rascall .  You !  What doe you meane ?  Nay I did intend to leave him part of my mind in writting before I went . â€”  You are a Pandarly Rascall , and I 'le be a terror both to you , and your Patron .  I am the sorrowfull one that is knowne by it Madam .  Well sir , you neede not doubt my high Carriage .  'T was through the blindnesse of my love , and my credulity Madam , wrought by his strong Temptations .  No , hee will then be the more vehement till his desire be over .  The Woman will not take it .
